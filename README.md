# project3 - COVID19 Pandemic Investment Analysis

Scope<br>
This repository demonstrates the use of various tools to perform ETL, structure a database, and a subsequent exploratory analysis of financial data during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple financial data sets were sourced from kaggle.com and finance.yahoo.com, including historical data for NASDAQ blue chip stocks and cryptocurrencies as well as sets on investor behavior and global market conditions. This data was cleaned in Jupyter notebook and uploaded to a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. Extraction from the newly generated database was demonstrated with the pandas.read_sql functionality. A comparative analysis was done to investigate the best investment strategy to maximize ROI for the average retail investor during the pandemic (2020-2022). 

Ethical Considerations<br>
Data Ethics is an important consideration for any data based project. Fortunately the scope of this project did not infringe on any existing conventions for data ethics. The stock data collected is publicly available and freely distributed. Since the data is factual in nature and widely available for public use, it is not original work. Additionally, the data contains no personally identifiable information and therefore meets the standard for fair use.
