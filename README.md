# project3

Scope
This repository demonstrates the use of various tools to perform ETL, structure a database, and resulting analysis of financial data during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple financial data sources were collected from kaggle.com and finance.yahoo.com, including blue chip stocks, cryptocurrencies, and market conditions. This data was cleaned in Jupyter notebook and uploaded to a PostgreSQL database. A comparative analysis was done to investigate the best method for ROI for the average retail investor during the pandemic (2020-2022). 

Ethical Considerations
Data Ethics is an important consideration in any data based project. Fortunately the scope of this project did not infringe on any existing conventions for data ethics. The stock data collected is publicly available and freely distributed. Since the data is factual in nature and widely available for public use, it is not original work, and it contains no personally identifiable information.
